### **Step 3: Configure Public Access**

- Go to **Permissions → Block Public Access → Edit**  
- Unchecked:
  - Block all public access  
  - Block new public bucket policies  
- Saved changes ✅  

#### **B. Add Bucket Policy**
- Allowed public read access for all objects with policy:  
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::elevatelab-s3-inter1/*"
    }
  ]
}
